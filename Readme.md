Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a process of classifying activity of a person using data received from
Accelerometer and Gyroscope sensor of a smartphone that is affected from human movement. I have tried
three models Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) to classify six activities (Walking ,Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying). The most accurate model tried is SVM with accuracy of 98.47%.
